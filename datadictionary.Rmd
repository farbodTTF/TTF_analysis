# Hub
The hub receives and processes data from all the different sensors

# MRT Sensor Prototype  
MRT sensor captures air and global temperature. MRT is useful for determining thermal comfort.

# Light Sensor
In the same way that a thermometer senses temperature, and a speedometer senses speed, the light sensor senses light. Data from the light sensor is used to differentiate cloudy days from sunny days.   

# TH Sensor 
This sensor measure temperature and humidity (TH).

# Anemometer 
The anemometer measures wind speed and direction.
